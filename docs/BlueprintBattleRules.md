### Game Objective and Rules for Blueprint Battle


Rack up the longest kill-streak in the arena.
You eliminate another player by firing a glowing ball into any part of their cube that isn’t covered by their shield arc.

2 · Your Cube
Visual	Meaning
Neon red outline	Your own cube (everyone sees themselves in red).
Cyan front arc	Shield + direction indicator.
Cyan filled dot inside	You are carrying a ball and can shoot.
No arc	You are sprinting (Speed Mode); shield is down.

3 · Controls
Key	Action
W / S or ↑ / ↓	Step one square forward / back.
A / D or ← / →	Snap-turn 90° left / right.
Space	• Pick up a ball if standing on a cyan dashed circle.
• Fire the ball if you’re already carrying one.
Shift (hold)	Speed Mode — continuous stepping as long as W/S is held, faster travel, but shield disappears.

4 · Moving & Looking
The camera is glued to your cube and rotates with you, so “up” on the keyboard is always forward.

When you sprint, the camera leans further ahead so you can see where you’re dashing.

5 · Ammo & Shooting
Find a cyan dashed circle on the floor → stand on it → press Space to load the ball.

Your cube now shows a cyan dot inside; that’s your ammo.

Face a target, press Space again to launch the ball.

The ball glows cyan, slows down over distance, and vanishes if it flies too far or hits something.

The screen will shake briefly when you fire.

6 · Shield & Blocking
The cyan arc blocks enemy balls that touch it.

The arc only covers the front 150°. Anything coming from the sides or back will hit you.

Sprinting (Shift) drops the shield—great for escape, risky in a firefight.

7 · Kills & Respawn
A ball that hits any unshielded face of a cube scores a kill.

In multiplayer builds, the victim instantly explodes and respawns after a short delay; the shooter’s streak increases by 1.

Dying resets your own streak to 0.

8 · The Map
The arena is a neon blueprint grid.

Solid squares are walkable; the dark void between them is not.

Ball spawn points appear randomly on walkable squares throughout the match.

9 · Winning
There is no end of game or win. The game is infinite.

Try to be the player with the highest kill-streak.


Quick Tips
Rotate first, move second. The shield only protects the direction you’re facing.

Sprint to chase or bail. Just remember you’re defenseless while Shift is held.

Bounce-backs happen. A ball that hits a shield reflects straight back—don’t shoot at a guarding opponent from the front.

Stay supplied. Without a ball you can’t fight; keep an eye out for new cyan circles.

Load up, roll out, and paint the grid with streaks. Good luck, Commander!
