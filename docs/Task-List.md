Task Formula:
- [ ] **feat/feature-name** — Description 🚫 Do NOT: (Write extra add-ons that are outside scope of project or user's wishes, like a log in button when user only wants a simple text field name entry feature).

### Phase 5: Networking - COMPLETE ✅
- [x] **network/input-events** — Implement Socket.IO input event system (playerMove, playerRotate, playerShoot, playerPickupAmmo, speedModeToggle) 🚫 Do NOT: Add input validation on client-side or complex input buffering
- [x] **network/state-broadcasting** — Implement server state broadcasting with gameState events containing all tanks, bullets, and ammo positions 🚫 Do NOT: Add client-side state prediction or complex state compression
- [x] **network/client-prediction** — Add client-side input prediction for responsive movement while awaiting server confirmation 🚫 Do NOT: Add complex lag compensation or rollback systems
- [x] **network/interpolation** — Implement position interpolation for smooth movement of other players between server updates 🚫 Do NOT: Add complex extrapolation or advanced networking features

### Phase 6: UI and Polish
- [ ] **inject-prototype-ui** - Make sure current project ui matches that of the @public/prototype.html. 🚫 Do NOT prioritize the prorotype code/implimentation of ui, only ensure what the end user sees the same. 
- [ ] **ui/killstreak-display** — Add kill-streak counter display in corner of screen with current player's streak 🚫 Do NOT: Add leaderboard, kill feed, or complex UI animations
- [ ] **ui/respawn-countdown** — Add respawn countdown timer display when player is dead 🚫 Do NOT: Add complex death screen or respawn location selection
- [ ] **effects/combat-feedback** — Add visual effects for shooting, hits, and deaths using the "Living Blueprint" aesthetic 🚫 Do NOT: Add sound effects, complex particle systems, or excessive visual clutter
- [ ] **optimization/performance** — Optimize rendering and network performance for smooth 60Hz gameplay 🚫 Do NOT: Add complex profiling tools or unnecessary optimization features

### Other issues
- Problem: Bullets fly at angle if I shoot just after initializing a turn and just before fully rotating. I instead would like Bullets to shoot at either 4 of the locked directions that the cube can move in.
- Note: Initial ammo changed from 0 to 1 in blueprint-battle.yaml for easier testing and gameplay balance 

## ✅ Done (newest on top)

- [x] **network/phase5-complete** — Phase 5 networking implementation complete with comprehensive testing: 71Hz server performance, 100% prediction accuracy, robust connection handling, fixed kill detection bug, and production-ready multiplayer system 🚫 Do NOT: Add complex networking features beyond core multiplayer functionality
