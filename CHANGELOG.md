## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Centralized UI System**: Complete rewrite of UI architecture with three core components:
  - `UIManager.js` - Centralized UI rendering system handling all UI states
  - `UIState.js` - Proper state machine for login → game → death → respawn flow
  - `UIComponents.js` - Reusable UI components with consistent styling

- **Comprehensive Color System**: 
  - Unified color palette with 22 color variables in YAML configuration
  - New color hierarchy: base, primary, accent, UI-specific colors
  - Consistent `ui_cyan` (#26c6da) across all UI elements
  - Legacy color aliases for backward compatibility

- **Typography System**:
  - 11 typography styles with proper size scale (display, heading, body, caption)
  - Font weight system (light to extrabold)
  - Letter spacing and line height standards
  - Predefined typography combinations for UI elements

- **Enhanced CSS Variables**:
  - Comprehensive CSS generation from YAML configuration
  - 22 color variables with utility classes
  - 11 typography size variables
  - Typography style classes for consistent styling
  - UI spacing and animation variables

- **UI State Machine**:
  - Proper state transitions between login, game, death, and respawn states
  - Centralized event handling and cleanup
  - Interactive element registration and hit testing
  - Memory management for UI components

### Changed
- **Refactored Login System**: 
  - Removed standalone `LoginOverlay.js` functionality
  - Integrated login overlay into centralized UIManager
  - Consistent frosted glass effects across all UI panels

- **Game Loop Integration**:
  - Modified main game loop to use UIManager for all UI rendering
  - Removed duplicate UI code from `game.js`
  - Proper separation between game rendering and UI rendering

- **Animation System**:
  - Removed UI rendering methods from `AnimationManager.js`
  - Eliminated duplicate leaderboard, kill streak, and death screen implementations
  - Focused AnimationManager on entity animations only

- **Color System Consolidation**:
  - Updated `spec/blueprint-battle.yaml` with organized color hierarchy
  - Removed hardcoded color values from UI components
  - Consolidated leaderboard-specific colors into main palette

### Fixed
- **Visual Inconsistencies**:
  - Unified frosted glass effects across all UI panels
  - Consistent color usage throughout the application
  - Proper DPI scaling on all devices
  - Eliminated font family and sizing inconsistencies

- **State Management Issues**:
  - Fixed UI state synchronization problems
  - Proper event listener cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  - Consistent error handling and display
  - Smooth transitions between game states

- **Code Duplication**:
  - Eliminated duplicate UI rendering code
  - Single implementation of frosted glass panels
  - Unified event handling patterns
  - Consistent canvas state management

### Technical Details
- **Files Added**:
  - `public/UIManager.js` - 800+ lines of centralized UI management
  - `public/UIState.js` - 400+ lines of state machine implementation
  - `public/UIComponents.js` - 600+ lines of reusable UI components

- **Files Modified**:
  - `spec/blueprint-battle.yaml` - Enhanced color system and typography
  - `build-css-vars.js` - Comprehensive CSS variable generation
  - `public/index.html` - Updated to include new UI system scripts
  - `public/game.js` - Refactored to use UIManager
  - `public/AnimationManager.js` - Removed duplicate UI methods

- **Performance Improvements**:
  - Reduced redundant UI rendering calls
  - Optimized canvas state management
  - Centralized event handling reduces overhead
  - Proper memory management prevents leaks

### Breaking Changes
- UI components now require initialization through UIManager
- Direct access to LoginOverlay methods no longer supported
- UI state must be managed through UIState class
- Color constants now accessed through centralized configuration

### Migration Guide
- Replace direct LoginOverlay usage with UIManager.showLogin()
- Update color references to use CONFIG.colors.ui_cyan
- Use UIManager.render() instead of individual UI drawing functions
- Initialize UIManager in place of LoginOverlay in game initialization
